Reletive zooming such that the distance between the centre (or mouse loc, not sure) of the fractal and the
centre of the screen scales with zoom level

    Current
        when zooming in, I divide all points between the screen edges by the zoom level, calculate those, then
        multiply them by the zoom level again, add the mouse loc and render that

    Objective:
        Scale the addition section by the zoom level so that it gets further away from the centre
        as it zooms in, so I am always zoomed in on the same section
