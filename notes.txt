Reletive zooming such that the distance between the centre (or mouse loc, not sure) of the fractal and the
centre of the screen scales with zoom level

    Current
        when zooming in, I divide all points between the negative and positive screen edges by the zoom level, calculate those, then
        multiply them by the zoom level again, add the mouse loc and render that

    Objective:
        Scale the addition section by the zoom level so that it gets further away from the centre
        as it zooms in, so I am always zoomed in on the same section
 
Find releative position from centre of fractal to the mouse_loc:
    cONST fractal distance (maybe depending on zoom level)
    Keep distance constant by adding that to every mouse loc



Get distance between mouse and centre of the fractal:
    add that - of that distance to the screen centre and set the fractal centre there

    additionally, I need to treat the fractal centre as the real center, and modify it by the other points.
    I need the offset from sc_centre to stay the same so that when I click on a part of the fractal, it moves the fractal
    centre by the distance to the fractal center, I think.



Store the fractal so when moving I don't have to render it multiple times
